For example, in the United States, the chief source of time for railroads and commercial purposes is the Naval Ob- servatory, at Georgetown Heights, Washington, D.C. There are three high-grade clocks keeping standard time at this observatory. Their errors are found from observations of the stars; and after applying cor- rections for these errors, the mean of the three clocks is taken as giving the true standard time for the successive 24 hours. At 5 minutes before noon, Eastern Time, the Western Union Telegraph Company and the Postal Telegraph Company suspend their ordinary business and throw their lines into electrical connection with the standard clock at the Naval Observatory. The connection is arranged so that the sounding key makes a stroke every second during the 5 minutes preceding noon except the twenty-ninth second of each minute, the last 5 seconds of the fourth minute, and the last 10 seconds of the ﬁfth minute. This gives many opportunities of determining the error of a clock. To simplify matters, clocks are connected so as to be automatically regulated by these signals, and there are at present more than 30, 000 of them in use in this country. The time signals are sent out from the Naval Obser- vatory with an error usually less than 0.2 of a second; but frequently this is considerably increased when a system of relays must be used to reach great distances. These noon signals also operate time balls in 18 ports in the United States. This device for furnishing time, chieﬂy to boat captains, con- sists of a large ball which is dropped at noon, Eastern Time, from a considerable height at conspicuous points, by means of electrical con- nection with the Naval Observatory. Time for the extreme western part of the United States is distributed from the Mare Island Navy Yard in California; and besides, a number of college observatories have been furnishing time to particular rail- road systems. Naturally most observatories regularly determine time for their own use, though with the accurate distribution of time from Washington the need for this work is disappearing except in certain special problems of star positions. 112. Civil and Astronomical Days.—The civil day begins at midnight, for then business is ordinarily suspended and the date can be changed with least inconvenience. The astronomical day of the same date begins at noon, 12 hours later; because, if the change were made at midnight, astronomers might ﬁnd it necessary to change the date in the midst of a set of observations. It is true that many observations of the sun and some other bodies are made in the daytime, but of course most'},\n",

X, 204] COMETS AND METEORS 283 At the time of a meteoric shower the meteors are not only more numerous than usual, but a majority of them move so that when their apparent paths are projected backward, they pass through, or very near, a point in the sky. This point is called the radiant point of the shower, for the meteors all appear to radiate from it. A number of meteor trails which clearly deﬁne a radiant point are shown in Fig. 130. The most conspicuous meteoric showers occur on November 15 and November 24 yearly. The former have their radiant in Leo, within the sickle, and are called the Leonids. From the position of this constella- Fig. 130. — Meteor trails deﬁning a radiant point (Olivier). tion (Arts. 82, 93), it follows that they can be seen only in the early morning hours. The latter have their radiant in Andromeda, and are called the Andromids. They can be seen only in the early part of the night. The Leonids and Andromids are not equally numerous every year. Great showers of the Leonids occurred in 1833 and 1866, and less remarkable ones, though greater than the ordinary, from 1898 to 1901. The Andromids appear in unusual numbers every thirteen years. Besides these meteoric showers, according to Denning, nearly 3000 other less conspicuous ones have been found. The Perseids appear for'},\n",

If the table is correct, the sun is far below the average of the stars in brilliancy. According to the measures of Wollaston, Bond, and Zöllner its magnitude on the stellar basis is −26.7, or it gives us 120, 000, 000, 000 times as much light as a ﬁrst-magnitude star. Since the light received from a body varies inversely as the square of its dis- tance, at the mean distance of the ﬁrst-magnitude stars the sun would send us only 0.005 as much light as comes from a ﬁrst-magnitude star. That is, the ﬁrst-magnitude stars average about 200 times as brilliant as the sun. It must not be concluded from this that the stars of all mag- nitudes average so much more brilliant than the sun, for those of the ﬁrst magnitude are a group selected because of their great brilliancy. 277. Distances of Moving Groups of Stars.—If the two com- ponents of a double star are found to be moving in the same direction and with the same apparent speed, the conclusion to be drawn is that they are relatively close together in space and that they are physically connected; for, if they were simply in the same direction from the earth without being related, their apparent motions would almost certainly diﬀer either in speed or direction. While the conclusion might be er- roneous in the case of only two stars, it could hardly fail to be true if many stars were involved. The study of the proper motions of the stars has shown that there are several groups which have sensibly identical proper motions; or rather, as the result of perspective, there are many stars which appar- ently move with the same speed toward a common point in the sky. These groups are widely scattered and many of their members would not be suspected of being associated with the others except for the equality of their motions. For example, Sirius belongs to a group which includes ﬁve of the stars in the Big Dipper. The best-known group of stars of the type under consideration com- prises part of the Hyades cluster, in the constellation Taurus, and some neighboring stars scattered over an area about 15◦in diameter. This group, which includes 39 known stars, was exhaustively discussed by Lewis Boss. The stars, in their proper motions, all seem to move along the arcs of great circles. Boss found that the great circles of all the stars of the Taurus stream intersect in a common point whose right ascension and declination are, for the position of the equinox in 1875, 6 h. 7.2 m. and +6◦56′. It can be shown that this means that the stars of the group are moving in lines parallel to the line from the observer'}]"

Place of Change of Date.—If one should start at any point on the earth and go entirely around it westward, the number of times the sun would cross his meridian would be one less than it would have been if he had stayed at home. Since it would be very inconvenient for him to use fractional dates, he would count his day from midnight to midnight, whatever his longitude, and correct the increasing diﬀerence from the time of his starting point by arbitrarily changing his date one day forward at some point in his journey. That is, he would omit one date and day of the week from his reckoning. On the other hand, if he were going around the earth eastward, he would give two days the same date and day of the week. The change is usually made at the 180th meridian from Greenwich. This is a particularly fortunate selec- tion, for the 180th meridian scarcely passes through any land surface at all, and then only small islands. One can easily see how trouble- some matters would be if the change were made at a meridian passing through a thickly populated region, say the meridian of Greenwich. On one side of it people would have a certain day and date, for example, Monday, December 24, and on the other side of it a day later, Tuesday, December 25. The place of actual change of date does not strictly follow the 180th meridian from Greenwich, for travelers, going eastward from Europe, lose half a day, while those going westward from Europe and America arrive in the same longitude with a gain of half a day; hence their dates diﬀer by one day. The change-of-date line is shown in Fig. 66. 114. The Sidereal Year.—The sidereal year is the time required for the sun apparently to move from any position with respect to the stars, as seen from the earth, around to the same position again. Per- haps it is better to say that it is the time required for the earth to make a complete revolution around the sun, directions from the sun being determined by the positions of the stars. Its length in mean solar time is 365 days, 6 hours, 9 minutes, 9.54 seconds, or just a little more than 365.25 days. 115. The Anomalistic Year.—The anomalistic year is the time required for the earth to move from the perihelion of its orbit around to the perihelion again. If the perihelion point were ﬁxed, this period would equal the sidereal year. But the attraction of the other plan- ets causes the perihelion point to move forward at such a rate that it completes a revolution in about 108, 000 years; and the consequence',\n",

The immense importance of mechanics in modern life is a measure of the value of this contribution of astronomy to science. The science of geography owes much to astronomy, both directly and indirectly. A great period of exploration followed the voyages of Columbus. It took courage of the highest order to sail for many weeks over an unknown ocean in the frail boats of his time. He had good reasons for thinking he could reach India, to the eastward, by sailing westward from Spain. His reasons were of an astronomical nature. He had seen the sun rise from the ocean in the east, travel across the sky and set in the west; he had observed that the moon and stars have similar motions; and he inferred from these things that the earth was of ﬁnite extent and that the heavenly bodies moved around it. This led him to believe it could be circumnavigated. Relying upon the conclusions that he drew from his observations of the motions of the heavenly bodies, he maintained control of his mutinous sailors during their perilous voyage across the Atlantic, and made a discovery that has been of immense consequence to the human race. One of the most important inﬂuences in modern scientiﬁc thought is the doctrine of evolution. It has not only largely given direction to investigations and speculations in biology and geology, but it has also been an important factor in the interpretation of history, social changes, and even religion. The ﬁrst clear ideas of the orderly development of the universe were obtained by contemplating the relatively simple celestial phenomena, and the doctrine of evolution was current in astronomical literature more than half a century before it appeared in the writings of Darwin, Spencer, and their contemporaries. In fact, it was carried directly from astronomy over into geology, and from geology into the biological sciences (Art. 242). 7. The Present Value of Astronomy.—From what has been said it will be admitted that astronomy has been of great importance in the development of science, but it is commonly believed that at the present time it is of little practical value to mankind. While its uses are by no means so numerous as those of physics and chemistry, it is nevertheless quite indispensable in a number of human activities. Safe navigation of the seas is absolutely dependent upon astronomy. In all long voyages the captains of vessels frequently determine their positions by observations of the celestial bodies. Sailors use the nautical mile, or knot, which approximately equals one and one sixth ordinary',\n",

These errors kept the predecessors of Newton from getting any satisfactory theories regarding the motions of the heavenly bodies. The second law deﬁnes how the change of motion of a body, in both direction and amount, depends upon the applied force. It asserts what happens when any force is acting, and this means that the statement is true whether or not there are other forces. In other words, the momen- tary eﬀects of forces can be considered independently of one another. For example, if two forces, PA and PB in Fig. 26, are acting on a body at P, it will move in the direction PA just as though PB were not Fig. 26. — The parallelogram of forces. acting on it, and it will move in the direction PB just as though PA were not acting on it. The result is that when they are both acting it will go from P to C along PC. Since PACB is a parallelo- gram, this is called the paral- lelogram law of the composi- tion of forces. The ﬁrst two laws refer to the motion of a single body; the third expresses the way in which two bodies act on each other. It means essentially that if one body changes the state of motion of another body, its own state of motion is also changed reciprocally in a deﬁnite way. The term “action” in the law means the mass times the rate of change of motion (acceleration) of the body. Hence the third law might read that if two bodies act on each other, then the product of the mass and acceleration in one is equal and opposite to the product of the mass and acceleration in the other. This is a complete statement of the way two bodies act upon each other. But the second law states that the product of the mass and acceleration of a body is proportional to the force acting on it. Hence it follows that the third law might read that if two bodies act on each other, then the force exerted by the ﬁrst on the second is equal and opposite to the force exerted by the second on the ﬁrst. This statement is not obviously true because it seems to contradict ordinary experience. For example, the law states that if a strong man and a weak man are pulling on a rope (weight of the rope being neglected) against each other, the strong man cannot pull any more than the weak man.

X, 208] AN INTRODUCTION TO ASTRONOMY 286 the earth are at present exceedingly slight, and it is very probable that their inﬂuences upon the rotations of the other members of the system are also inappreciable. A retardation in the translatory motion of a body causes its orbit to decrease in size. Hence, so far as the meteors aﬀect the planets in this way, they cause them continually to approach the sun. Another eﬀect of meteors upon the members of the solar system is to increase their masses by the accretion of matter which may have come originally from far beyond the orbit of Neptune. As the masses of the sun and planets increase, their mutual attractions increase and the orbits of the planets become smaller. Looking backward in time, we are struck by the possibility that the accretion of meteoric matter may have been more rapid in former times, and that it may have been an important factor in the growth of the planets from much smaller bodies. 208. Meteorites.—Sometimes bodies weighing from a few pounds up to several hundred pounds, or even a few tons, dash into the earth’s atmosphere, glow brilliantly from the heat generated by the friction, roar like a waterfall, occasionally produce violent detonations, and end by falling on the earth. Such bodies are called meteorites, siderites, or aërolites. About two or three meteorites are seen to fall yearly; but, since a large part of the earth is covered with water or is uninhabited for other reasons, it is probable that in all at least 100 strike the earth annually. The outside of a meteorite during its passage through the air is subject to intense and sudden heating, and the rapid expansion of its surface layers often breaks it into many fragments. The surface is fused and on striking cools rapidly. The result is that it has a black, glossy structure, usually with many small pits where the less refractive material has been melted out. Since meteors pass entirely through the atmosphere in a few seconds, only their surfaces give evidence of the extremes of heat and pressure to which they have been subjected in their ﬁnal ﬂight. Most meteors are composed of stone, though it is often mixed with some metallic iron. Even where pure iron is not present, some of its compounds are usually found. About three or four out of every hundred are nearly pure iron with a little nickel. All together about 30 elements which occur elsewhere on the earth have been found in meteorites, but no strange ones.

X, 204] AN INTRODUCTION TO ASTRONOMY 282 is one half its mass multiplied by the square of its velocity, the mass of the meteor can be computed because its light energy and velocity can be determined directly from observations by the methods which have just been described. By such means it has been found that ordinarily the masses of meteors do not exceed a few tenths of an ounce. How- ever, the observational data are diﬃcult to determine and the subject has received relatively less attention than it deserves. Consequently, no great reliance should be placed on the precise numerical results. 203. The Number of Meteors.—If a person scans the sky an hour or so and ﬁnds that he can see only a few meteors, he is tempted to draw the conclusion that the number of them which strike the earth’s atmosphere daily is not very large. He bases his conclusion mostly on the fact that half of the celestial sphere is within his range of vision, but a diagram representing the earth and its atmosphere to scale will show him that he can see by no means half the meteors which strike the earth’s atmosphere. As a matter of fact, he can see the atmosphere over only a few square miles of the earth’s surface. From very many counts of the number of meteors which can be seen from a single place during a given time, it has been computed that between 10 and 20 millions of them strike into the earth’s atmosphere daily. There are probably several times this number which are so small that they escape observation. Often when astronomers are working with telescopes they see faint meteors dart across the ﬁeld of vision which would be quite invisible with the unaided eye. Meteors enter the earth’s atmosphere from every direction. The places where they strike the earth and the velocities of their encounter depend both upon their own velocities and also upon that of the earth around the sun. The side of the earth which is ahead in its motion encounters more meteors than the opposite, for it receives not only those which it meets, but also those which it overtakes, while the part of the earth which is behind receives only those which overtake it. The meridian is on the forward side of the earth in the morning and on the rearward side in the evening. It is found by observation that more meteors are seen in the morning than in the evening, and that the relative velocities of impact are greater. 204. Meteoric Showers.—Occasionally unusual numbers of me- teors are seen, and then it is said that there is a meteoric shower. There have been a few instances in which meteors were so numerous that they could not be counted, but usually not more than one or two appear in a minute.',\n",

Families of the ﬁrst type are made up of comets which pursue nearly identical paths. The most celebrated family of this type is composed of the great comets of 1668, 1843, 1880, and 1882. A much smaller one seen in 1887 probably should be added to this list. Their orbits were not only nearly identical, but the comets themselves were very similar in every respect. They came to the sun from the direction of Sirius—that is, from the direction away from which the sun is moving with respect to the stars—and escaped the notice of observers in the northern hemisphere until they were near perihelion. They passed half way around the sun in a few hours at a distance of less than 200, 000 miles from its surface, moving at the enormous velocity of more than 350 miles per second. Their tails extended out in dazzling splendor 100, 000, 000 miles from their heads. One might think that the various members of a comet family are but the successive appearances of the same comet; but such is not the case, for the observations show that though their orbits may be ellipses, their periods are at least 600 or 800 years.',\n",

The history of Sirius during the last two centuries is very interesting, and furnishes a good illustration of the value of the deductive method in making discoveries. First, Halley found, in 1718, that Sirius has a mo- tion with respect to ﬁxed reference points and lines; then, a little more than a century later, Bessel found that this motion is slightly variable. He inferred from this, on the basis of the laws of motion, that Sirius and an unseen companion were traveling around their common cen- ter of gravity which was moving with uniform speed in a straight line. This companion actually was discovered by Alvan G. Clark, in 1862, while adjusting the 18-inch telescope now of the Dearborn Observa- tory, at Evanston, Ill. The distance of the two stars from each other is 1, 800, 000, 000 miles, and they complete a revolution in 48.8 years. The combined mass of the two stars is about 3.4 times that of the sun. The larger star is only about twice as massive as its companion but is 20, 000 times brighter; together they radiate 48 times as much light as is emitted by the sun.100. Canis Minor (The Lesser Dog).—Canis Minor is directly east of Orion and is of particular interest in the present connection because of its ﬁrst-magnitude star Procyon, which is about 25◦east and just a little south of Betelgeuze.',\n",

Let x represent the absolute temperature of Mars; then, under the assumption that its surface is like that of the earth, the proportion becomes x : 519 = 4 √ 0.43 : 4 √ 1, from which it is found that x = 420◦. That is, under these hypotheses, the mean surface temperature of Mars comes out 491◦−420◦= 71◦ below freezing, or 71◦−32◦= 39◦below zero Fahrenheit. The results just obtained can lay no claim to any particular degree of accuracy because of the uncertain hypotheses on which they rest. But it does not seem that the hypothesis that the surfaces of Mars and the earth radiate similarly can be enough in error to change the results by very many degrees. If the atmosphere of Mars were of the same constitution as that of the earth, but simply more tenuous, its actual temperature would be lower than that found by the computa- tion. On the other hand, if the atmosphere of Mars contained an abun- dance of gases which strongly absorb and retain heat, such as water vapor and carbon dioxide, its mean temperature might be considerably above −39◦.\n",

Temperature and Pressure in the Earth’s Interior.—There are many reasons for believing that the interior of the earth is very hot. For example, volcanic phenomena prove that at least in many localities the temperature is above the melting point of rock at a comparatively short distance below the earth’s surface. Geysers and hot springs show that the interior of the earth is hot at many other places. Besides this, the temperature has been found to rise in deep mines at the rate of about one degree Fahrenheit for a descent of 100 feet, the amount depending somewhat on the locality. Suppose the temperature should go on increasing at the rate of one degree for every hundred feet from the surface to the center of the earth. At a depth of ten miles it would be over 500 degrees, at 100 miles over 5000 degrees, at 1000 miles over 50, 000 degrees, and at the center of the earth over 200, 000 degrees. While there is no probability that the rate of increase of temperature which prevails near the surface keeps up to great depths, yet it is reasonably certain that at a depth of a few hundred miles it is several thousand degrees.\n",

On account of the blanketing eﬀect of the atmosphere, less heat is radiated than is received; hence the temperature continues to rise. But after that date less and less heat is received as day succeeds day; on the other hand, more is radiated daily, for the hotter a body gets, the faster it radiates. In a few weeks the loss equals, and then exceeds, that which is received, after which the temperature begins to fall. The same reasoning applies for all the other seasons. This phenomenon is quite analogous to the familiar fact that the maximum daily temperature normally occurs somewhat after noon. If there were no atmosphere and if the earth radiated heat as fast as it was acquired, there would be no lag in the seasons. In high altitudes, where the air is thin and dry, this condition is nearly realized and the lag of the seasons is small, though the phenomenon is very much disturbed by the great air currents which do much to equalize temperatures.61.

Consequently, when the sun rises for a point on the moon, its rays continue to beat down upon the surface, which is entirely unprotected by clouds or air, for more than 14 of our days. During this time the temperature rises above the freezing point and it may even go up to the boiling point. When the sun sets, the darkness of midnight immediately follows because there is no atmosphere to produce twilight, and the heat rapidly escapes into space. In the course of an hour or two the temperature of the surface probably falls below the freezing point, and in the course of a day or two it may descend to 100◦below zero. It will either remain there or descend still lower until the sun rises again 14 days after it has set.

About 7 per cent of the heat which falls on the moon is directly reﬂected, and this has no eﬀect upon its temperature. The remaining 93 per cent is absorbed and raises the temperature of its surface.

When the sun is north of the celestial equator so that its rays strike the surface in northern latitudes most nearly perpendicularly, a condition that tends to produce high temperatures, the greater distance of the sun reduces them somewhat. Therefore, the temperature does not rise in the summer so high as it would if the earth’s orbit were cir- cular. In the winter time, at the same place, when the sun’s rays strike the surface slantingly, the earth is nearer to the sun than the average, and consequently the temperature does not fall so low as it would if the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit were zero. The result is that the seasonal variations in the northern hemisphere are less extreme than they would be if the earth’s orbit were circular; and, for the opposite reason, in the southern hemisphere they are more extreme. This does not mean that actually there are greater extremes in the temperature south of the equator than there are north of the equator. The larger proportion of water in the southern hemisphere, which tends to make temperature conditions uniform, may more than oﬀset the eﬀects of the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit. The attractions of the other planets for the earth change very slowly both the eccentricity and the direction of the perihelion of the earth’s orbit.

Now the amount of heat a body radiates depends on the character of its surface and on its temperature. In this calculation the surfaces of Mars and the earth are assumed to be alike. According to Stefan’s law, which has been veriﬁed both theoretically and experimentally, the radiation of a black body varies as the fourth power of its absolute temperature.

On using Stefan’s law as a basis for computation, it is found that the temperature of the radiating layers of the sun is at least 10, 000◦Fahrenheit. Or, it would be more accurate to say that an ideal radiating surface at this temperature would have the same rate of radiation as the sun, and since the sun is not a perfect radiator, its temperature is probably still higher. This temperature is several thousand degrees higher than has been obtained in the most eﬃcient electrical furnaces, and is far beyond that required to melt or vaporize any known terrestrial substance; yet, the temperature of the interior of the sun is undoubtedly far higher. Another method of determining the temperature of the sun is from the proportion of energy of diﬀerent wave lengths which it radiates. A body of low temperature radiates relatively a large amount of red light and a small amount of blue light. As the temperature rises the relative proportion of blue light increases. The uncertainties in the results obtained by this method of determining the temperature of the sun arise, in the ﬁrst place, from the fact that, at the best, it is not very precise, and, in the second place, from the fact that both the sun’s and the earth’s atmospheres absorb very unequally radiant energy of various wave lengths.

And (c) it distributes water over the surface of the earth. (a) Consider the day side of the earth. The rays of the sun are partly absorbed by the atmosphere and the heating of the earth’s surface is thereby reduced. The amount absorbed at sea level is possibly as much as 40 per cent.

But it will be noticed from Fig.44 that, although the summer is longer in the northern hemisphere than it is in the southern, the earth is then farther from the sun. It can be shown from a discussion of the way in which the earth’s distance from the sun varies and from the rate at which it moves at diﬀerent points in its orbit, that the longer summer season in the northern hemisphere is exactly counterbalanced by the greater distance the earth is then from the sun. The result is that points in corresponding latitudes north and south of the equator receive in the whole year exactly the same amount of light and heat from the sun.

He arrived at the conclusion that 40 per cent of the rays striking the atmosphere perpendicularly, when it is free from clouds, are absorbed before they reach the surface of the earth; later investigations have reduced this estimate to 35 per cent. The work initiated by Langley has been continued most successfully by Abbott, Fowle, and Aldrich, and they ﬁnd that the rate at which radiant energy of all wave lengths is received by the earth from the sun at the outer surface of our atmosphere when the sun is at its mean distance is, in terms of mechanical work, 1.51 horse power per square yard. The earth intercepts a cylinder of rays from the sun whose cross sec- tion is equal to a circle whose diameter equals the diameter of the earth. The area of this circle is, therefore, πr2, where r equals 3955 × 1760 = 6, 960, 800 yards.1 Hence the rate at which solar energy is intercepted by the whole earth is in round numbers 230, 000, 000, 000, 000 horse power. In the evolution of life upon the earth the sun has been as important a factor as the earth itself. Consequently, geologists and biologists have a deep interest in the sun, and particularly in the question whether or not its rate of radiation is constant. It has long been supposed that probably the sun is slowly cooling oﬀand that the light and heat re- ceived from it are gradually diminishing, but it was a distinct surprise when Langley and Abbott found that its rate of radiation sometimes varies in a few days by as much as 10 per cent. If a change of this amount in the rate of radiation of the sun were to persist indeﬁnitely, the mean temperature of the earth would be changed about 13◦Fahren- heit; but a variation of 10 per cent for only a few days has no important eﬀect on the climate.\n",

The fact that its altitude at noon is 23◦.5 greater than it is when the sun is on the equator, and the longer time from sunrise to sunset, are the reasons that the temperature is higher in the summer than in the spring or autumn.

If it had contracted only from the distance of the earth’s orbit, the amount of heat that would have been generated would have been about one half of one per cent less. Therefore, according to the contraction theory, the earth can have received heat from the sun at its present rate only about 20, 000, 000 years. If the sun is strongly condensed at its center, this time limit should be increased about 5, 000, 000 years. In the future, according to this theory, the sun will contract more and more until it ceases to be gaseous. Probably by the time its mean density equals 5 its temperature will begin to fall. A contraction to this density will produce enough heat to supply the present rate of radiation only 10, 000, 000 years.

This makes no appeal to the imagination because the numbers are so extremely far beyond all experience. A much better method is to give its density, which is obtained by dividing its mass by its volume. With water at its greatest density as a standard, the average density of the earth is 5.53. The average density of the earth to the depth of a mile or two is in the neighborhood of 2.75. Therefore there are much denser materials in the earth’s interior; their greater density may be due either to their composition or to the great pressure to which they are subject. The density of quartz (sand) is 2.75, limestone 3.2, cast iron 7.1, steel 7.8, lead 11.3, mercury 13.6, gold 19.3, and platinum 21.5. It follows that no considerable part of the earth can be composed of such heavy substances as mercury, gold, and platinum, but, so far as these considerations bear on the question, it might be largely iron. The distribution of density in the earth was worked out over 100 years ago by Laplace on the basis of a certain assumption regarding the compressibility of the matter of which it is composed.\n",

It has been stated that the mean apparent diameter of the moon is 31′ 5′′.2. The apparent diameter of the moon varies both because its distance from the center of the earth varies, and also because when the moon is on the observer’s meridian, he is nearly 4000 miles nearer to it than when it is on his horizon. In the observations of other celestial objects the small distance of 4000 miles makes no appreciable diﬀerence in their appearance; but, since the distance from the earth to the moon is, in round numbers, only 240, 000 miles, the radius of the earth is 1 60 of the whole amount.

    "Query: What are the fat-soluble vitamins?\n",
    "Answer: The fat-soluble vitamins include Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, and Vitamin K. These vitamins are absorbed along with fats in the diet and can be stored in the body's fatty tissue and liver for later use. Vitamin A is important for vision, immune function, and skin health. Vitamin D plays a critical role in calcium absorption and bone health. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage. Vitamin K is essential for blood clotting and bone metabolism.\n",
    "\\nExample 2:\n",
    "Query: What are the causes of type 2 diabetes?\n",
    "Answer: Type 2 diabetes is often associated with overnutrition, particularly the overconsumption of calories leading to obesity. Factors include a diet high in refined sugars and saturated fats, which can lead to insulin resistance, a condition where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin. Over time, the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to manage blood sugar levels, resulting in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, excessive caloric intake without sufficient physical activity exacerbates the risk by promoting weight gain and fat accumulation, particularly around the abdomen, further contributing to insulin resistance.\n",
    "\\nExample 3:\n",
    "Query: What is the importance of hydration for physical performance?\n",
    "Answer: Hydration is crucial for physical performance because water plays key roles in maintaining blood volume, regulating body temperature, and ensuring the transport of nutrients and oxygen to cells. Adequate hydration is essential for optimal muscle function, endurance, and recovery. Dehydration can lead to decreased performance, fatigue, and increased risk of heat-related illnesses, such as heat stroke. Drinking sufficient water before, during, and after exercise helps ensure peak physical performance and recovery.\n",

These vitamins are absorbed along with fats in the diet and can be stored in the body\\'s fatty tissue and liver for later use. Vitamin A is important for vision, immune function, and skin health. Vitamin D plays a critical role in calcium absorption and bone health. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage. Vitamin K is essential for blood clotting and bone metabolism.\\n\\nExample 2:\\nQuery: What are the causes of type 2 diabetes?\\nAnswer: Type 2 diabetes is often associated with overnutrition, particularly the overconsumption of calories leading to obesity. Factors include a diet high in refined sugars and saturated fats, which can lead to insulin resistance, a condition where the body\\'s cells do not respond effectively to insulin. Over time, the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to manage blood sugar levels, resulting in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, excessive caloric intake without sufficient physical activity exacerbates the risk by promoting weight gain and fat accumulation, particularly around the abdomen, further contributing to insulin resistance.\\n\\nExample 3:\\nQuery: What is the importance of hydration for physical performance?\\nAnswer: Hydration is crucial for physical performance because water plays key roles in maintaining blood volume, regulating body temperature, and ensuring the transport of nutrients and oxygen to cells. Adequate hydration is essential for optimal muscle function, endurance, and recovery. Dehydration can lead to decreased performance, fatigue, and increased risk of heat-related illnesses, such as heat stroke. Drinking sufficient water before, during, and after exercise helps ensure peak physical performance and recovery.\\n\\nNow use the following context items to answer the user query:\\n- These “rice grains,” as they are sometimes called, have been resolved into smaller elements having a diameter of not over 100 miles; and although all these granules together do not constitute over one ﬁfth of the sun’s surface, yet, according to Langley’s estimates, they radiate about three fourths of the light. A small portion of the sun’s surface highly magniﬁed is shown in Fig.143. The photosphere of the sun gives a continuous spectrum. Therefore, according to the ﬁrst law of spectrum analysis, it is a solid, liquid, or gas under great pressure. Since the photosphere is not transparent there is a strong inclination to infer that it is liquid, or at least consists of clouds of liquid particles (carbon, iron, calcium, etc.)ﬂoating in a\\n- [ch. XI, 234] THE SUN 327 result in view of the great extent of the sun’s atmosphere and the fact that gravity at the surface of the sun is nearly 28 times as great as it is at the surface of the earth. Possibly electrical repulsion from the sun and light pressure partly oﬀset the great surface gravity of the sun.234. Chemical Constitution of the Reversing Layer.—Of the 14, 000 lines in Rowland’s spectrum about one third are due to the absorption by the earth’s atmosphere, and the remainder are pro- duced by the sun’s reversing layer and chromosphere. By comparing the positions of the lines of the sun’s spectrum with those given by the various elements in laboratory experiments, it is possible to infer the chemical constitution of the material which produces the absorption. In this manner 38 elements are known certainly to exist in the sun, but more than 6000 of the lines mapped by Rowland have not as yet been identiﬁed as belonging to any element. The presence of iron is established by more than 2000 line coinci- dences, carbon by more than 200, calcium by more than 75, magnesium by 20, sodium by 11, copper by 2, and lead by 1. It will be noticed that nearly all the elements in the table which follows are metals, the exceptions being hydrogen, helium, carbon, and oxygen. On the other hand, a number of heavy metals, such as gold and mercury, are miss- ing.\\n- The following table gives the elements found in the sun and their atomic weights. While the presence of the spectral lines of an element proves its existence, their absence does not show that it is not present. In the ﬁrst place, heavy elements, like gold, mercury, and platinum, would probably sink far below the level of the reversing layer, and conse- quently would give no lines in the solar spectrum. Then, again, the characteristic spectra of some of the elements, particularly non-metals, are suppressed by the presence of some other elements, particularly metals. Sometimes the spectrum of an element is entirely obliterated by the presence of a small percentage of another element. This may be the explanation of the fact that the spectra of ﬂuorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, sulphur, selenium, tellurium, nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and boron are not found in the sun, although most of these elements occur abundantly in the earth. Some elements have spectra that change radically with alterations in their conditions of temperature, pressure, and electrical excitation. One of these elements is oxygen, which was long sought for in the sun before it was certainly found. Of course, the proof of its existence was complicated by the fact that it occurs in abundance in the earth’s atmosphere.

It has the appearance of being rather sharply deﬁned, Fig.141, and it is the boundary used to deﬁne the size of the sun, but the sun is disturbed by such violent vertical motions that it is probably very broken in outline. At the distance of the sun from the earth an object 500 miles across subtends an angle of only one second of arc, and, therefore, irregularities in the photosphere would not be visible unless they amounted to several hundred miles. The part of the sun interior to the photosphere is always invisible. Above the photosphere lies a sheet of gas, probably from 500 to 1000 miles thick, which is called the reversing layer because, as will be seen (Art.233), it produces a reversed, or absorption, spectrum. It contains many terrestrial substances, such as calcium and iron, in a vaporous state. Outside of the reversing layer is another layer of gas, from 5000 to 10, 000 miles deep, called the chromosphere (color sphere). At the time of a total eclipse of the sun it is seen as a brilliant scarlet fringe whose outer surface seems to be covered with leaping ﬂames.\\n\\nRelevant passages: <extract relevant passages from the context here>\\nUser query: What is sun made up of\\nAnswer:\"\"\"<end_of_turn>\\n<start_of_turn>model\\n'"
